## Introduction

Alright, we have another week of Monday Makeover! Again, I will be doing the first pass in R and them coming back with a nice visual in Tableau. 


The visual being analyzed this week is below in figure 1. 

```{r week 23 viz, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig. 1: Viz of the week", cache = TRUE}

library(knitr)
library(png)

img1_path <- "visual 2020w23.png"

include_graphics(img1_path)

```
