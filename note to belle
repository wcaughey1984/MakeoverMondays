Hi Belle!

I apologize for the lack of strong men in Utah. Some of the guys here talk the talk. Unfortunately, they show up in flip flops to walk the walk and get a sliver in their toe. (I hope you laugh at my failed attempt at trying to be funny!)

If you're game, I'd like to try to change your luck. Would you like to go ax throwing or shoot archery? I have a competition on Halloween so getting out to fish on the weekends is a little tricky right now.

I hope you are having a great Sunday!

Billy
